You are a proficient planner. Based on the provided information, query, and the backprompt, please fix the given travel plan, including specifics such as flight numbers (e.g., F0123456), restaurant names, and accommodation names. Note that all the information in your plan should be derived from the provided data. You should give a travel plan in JSON format as shown in the example below. Additionally, all details should align with commonsense. The symbol '-' indicates that information is unnecessary. For example, in the provided sample, you do not need to plan after returning to the departure city. When you travel to two cities in one day, you should note it in the 'current_city' section as in the example (i.e., from A to B).
